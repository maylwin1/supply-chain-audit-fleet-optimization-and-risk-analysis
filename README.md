Supply Chain Analytics: Fleet Optimization & Risk Audit
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying operational inefficiencies and financial leaks within a large-scale logistics network. By analyzing three years of delivery, maintenance, and incident data (2022–2024), I uncovered a critical "Service-Profit Paradox" where high fleet activity was negatively impacting delivery reliability.

The analysis revealed that $1.73M of the $2.64M total liability was caused by mechanical failures rather than driver error, pinpointing an aging fleet as the primary business risk.

🛠️ Tech Stack
SQL: Data cleaning, table joins, and complex aggregations.

Excel: Data modeling, Pivot Tables, and interactive Dashboard design.

📊 Key Insights & Findings
1. The Reliability Gap
Fleet Utilization: 81.6% (indicating a near-capacity operation).

On-Time Delivery (OTD): 55.7% (stagnated despite high volume).

The Problem: The lack of "buffer capacity" in the schedule means minor delays become cascading failures.

2. Fleet Age & Financial Impact
Concentration Risk: A massive spike of 78 vehicles from 2015 is driving the majority of maintenance costs.

Equipment Damage: These older units are directly responsible for a $740k annual equipment damage bill.

Brand Performance: Volvo assets show the highest profit-to-expense ratio, while International units lead in safety incident frequency.

3. Liability & Risk Analysis
At-Fault vs. Not-At-Fault: 65% of total costs ($1.73M) are "False" (not driver-at-fault), suggesting mechanical or third-party issues.

Geospatial Risk: The Southeast region shows the highest Average Risk Score (0.62), largely due to concentrated DOT violations.

🚀 Recommendations
Modernize Asset Base: Phased retirement of the 2015 model-year fleet to reduce the $740k equipment damage drain.

Strategic Maintenance: Deploy targeted inspections in high-risk "Hot Zones" (Southeast) to prevent costly DOT violations.

KPI Shift: Transition driver metrics from "Miles Driven" to "OTD Accuracy" to improve the 55.7% reliability rating.
